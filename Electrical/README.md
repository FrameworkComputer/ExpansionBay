# Expansion Bay Electrical Design
**Warning**: the documentation here is pretty early, so there may be minor adjustments in the 
mechanical or electrical designs before the Framework Laptop 16 launches. We'll let you know when
the design is locked for production.

## KiCAD Symbol and Footprint
We haven't tested these, but there are two community member-created footprints for this interface:

## Pinout
There are two 74-pin interposers that are connected together to form the Expansion Bay Interface.  One is primarily for power, 
while the other is primarily for PCIe, DisplayPort, and other high speed signals.

| 1       | VSYS_GPU          | I   | Power |              | N/A        | 7~20V     | 0.75A   | Main power rail to Expansion Bay Modules from Vsys.  While on battery, Vsys can be as low as 15.2V (3.8Vx4), and sustained current will also be limited.  While on AC with a high power adapter, Vsys will be 20V, with maximum current up to 10.5A.   However, thermal limits and regulator efficiency could limit the practical maximum power to lower. |                                                               | 8      | PA  |
