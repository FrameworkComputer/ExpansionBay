# Framework Laptop 16 Expansion Bay Modules
![ExpansionBay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28994301/226250626-f826d576-5e1f-4112-a077-6ac71b7851d8.png)

The Framework Laptop 16 has an Expansion Bay system that contains both the cooling fans
and an interface for high-power, high-speed PCIe peripherals like GPUs.  Expansion Bay
modules can extend in both thickness and depth to accomodate higher power requirements.

There are currently two Expansion Bay modules available:

 1. Expansion Bay Shell - This module has two cooling fans for the system as well as an open area 
 in the middle that can be used for PCIe peripherals like SSDs or even additional I/O that can
 be exposed on the back of the system.  This GitHub repository documents the mechanical 
 and electrical specifications for the cards that can go in the Shell.
 2. Graphics Module - This module is thicker and deeper, and contains a GPU card along with
 the heatsink for it.
 
**Warning**: the documentation here is pretty early, so there may be minor adjustments in the mechanical or electrical designs before the Framework Laptop 16 launches. We'll let you know when the design is locked for production.
